* snowlaps ‚ùÑÔ∏èü¶†üèîÔ∏è

=snowlaps= is a Python package built on a deep learning emulator of
the two-stream radiative transfer model [[https://biosnicar.vercel.app/][biosnicar]]. It was originally
developed to study the impact of different Light Absorbing Particles
(LAPs) on snow spectral albedo as part of a [[https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2583][research project]] in
Southern Norway. Now, =snowlaps= has grown into a library with two
main use cases.

- *forward mode*: predict snow spectral albedo from prescribed surface
  properties as a fast alternative to [[https://biosnicar.vercel.app/][biosnicar]].
- *inverse mode*: infer surface properties from snow spectral albedo
  observations.
